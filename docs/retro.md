# Restrospectives

## 2023/06/07

What went well?
* Our consistency in scheduling and attending meetings
* Consistently made development progress
* Team member transitions

What went poorly?
* General git strategy
* Keeping code organized -- cleaning up log and print statements and unused code
* Hitting walls of contribution -- struggling to steer away after multiple failures
* Keeping track of the TODO list
* Doing retros -- keeping to rigid Scrum timeline

What do we want to do differently next time?
* Continue to focus an using an organized git branching strategy: https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
* Continue using Conventional Commit practices as applicable: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
* Revisit the TODO list more often -- flesh out sub-TODOs more frequently
* See what we can do with notion.so, or Trello
