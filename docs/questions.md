## For Production

    * ADFS account
    * Email + password
    * Google account
    * Different permission levels?
    * Verify @logicalposition.com email address

    * Possibly internally on something like AWS
    * Google Hosting


## For Testing

    * Direct feedback on manual input options
    * What else would you like to change?
    * Any desired formatting changes to the powerpoint?
* How we testing / ensuring PPTs are correct?
    * I think this initial testing period should be internal only -- no documents sent outside of LP


## For Clients
* Discuss options for final hosting.
    * Pricing considerations (it can possibly be free, we'll see in testing)
    * Maintaince access
* What are management's wishes for security / access control?
    * Does it need to be walled from the public?
    * Who should have permission to submit audits?


## For Development
* What types of logs should we keep?
* How should we structure receiving feedback from testers?
    * What feedback are we specifically looking for, if any?
    * Should we create any specific channels for testers to submit feedback? Perhaps like an email link on the application itself.
    * Where and how should we compile this feedback?
